python-students -- A Github repo of useful code (and other open source learning material) for people learning Python
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

python-students is a repo of useful code and open source reference material for students learning python.

The idea is for people learning python to share useful code snipets, reference code and code they have found to be useful in learning
key concepts.

* Clone the repo and explore.
* Provide feedback and improve.
* Submit your own code to help others.


## REPO STRUCTURE

The repository's contents are designed to be navigated by humans.

## ADDING TEXT FILES

If you want to add a text file please use markdown only. This is because I plan to eventually build a static site from the contents of the repo.

You can learn more about markdown at [Wikipedia] (linkref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

This readme file is written in markdown. For a taster of how simple it is open it up in a text editor.

## ADDING CODE

If you want to add code please ensure the following applies

* Your code runs and is error free in Python 2.6
* All code is fully commented. The more comprehensive your commenting for python students the better!
* All code is formatted using [PEP-8] (linkref:http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Unless you are specifically demonstrating OS specific techniques all code should work on all OS's

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
1. Hack away
1. Ideally add tests and make sure everything passes
1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in a README (use markdown)
1. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
1. Push the branch up to GitHub
1. Send a pull request to the github/curphey/python-students project.
